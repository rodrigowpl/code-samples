## Code sample for demonstration purposes

### The context
The goal of this code sample is to show how I normally code big projects. On this specific example I'm reffering to a platform called [Odyssey](https://www.join-odyssey.com/). 

I've choose this piece of code because It's a recent amazing project that I've worked where I had the opportunity to create a brand new product from scratch where I've implemented several patterns and clean archicture principles -- which makes me proud and happy with the result.

The sample code is responsible to a specific use-case, where the goal is a booking functionality.

## Use-case (service)
This service is responsible to load a set of events from all hosts(users) from database repositories, filter elligible sessions, for instance: active sessions, future sessions, generate recurrent instances and adapt/normalize to what the client is expecting.

## Component
The component, which represents the frontend part of that feature is to show how I normally code a component. Focosing in a good naming, separation of concerns in smaller components and hooks, styling, etc. Below I will attach a print screen how the final result looks like.
